NAME="ruby-hpricot"
VERSION=0.8.6
RELEASE=1
CATEGORY="Ruby"
SUMMARY="Ruby HTML parser module"
DESCRIPTION="Hpricot is a fast, flexible HTML parser written in C.  It's
designed to be very accommodating (like Tanaka Akira's HTree) and to have
a very helpful library (like some JavaScript libs -- JQuery, Prototype --
give you.)  The XPath and CSS parser, in fact, is based on John Resig's JQuery."
