ldesc: "Hpricot is a fast, flexible HTML parser written in C.  It's 
designed to be very accommodating (like Tanaka Akira's HTree) and to 
have a very helpful library (like some JavaScript libs -- JQuery, 
Prototype -- give you.)  The XPath and CSS parser, in fact, is based on 
John Resig's JQuery."
